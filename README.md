The `java/DSA/` folder contains a collection of beginner to intermediate-level Java programs focused on Data Structures and Algorithms. <br/>
These include essential coding problems like finding prime numbers, calculating factorials and GCD/LCM, checking for palindromes, and performing array operations.<br/>
The programs are written in simple, clean Java and are great for practicing core logic building, preparing for coding interviews, or revising DSA concepts. <br/>
Some files also demonstrate small project implementations such as temperature calculations and array manipulations.
