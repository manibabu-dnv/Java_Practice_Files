The `java/DSA/` folder contains a collection of beginner to intermediate-level Java programs focused on Data Structures and Algorithms. 
These include essential coding problems like finding prime numbers, calculating factorials and GCD/LCM, checking for palindromes, and performing array operations.
The programs are written in simple, clean Java and are great for practicing core logic building, preparing for coding interviews, or revising DSA concepts. 
Some files also demonstrate small project implementations such as temperature calculations and array manipulations.
